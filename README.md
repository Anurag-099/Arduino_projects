# Arduino Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of Arduino projects. This repository contains a collection of my hands-on work, from basic "Hello, World!" examples to more complex sensor integrations.

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes the source code, a circuit diagram, and a link to a live simulation on Tinkercad.
